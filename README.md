# VideoInterpreterAI

## Alex's branch

Test folder contains an example used for testing webui's conn.py used in communication with container (simulating llama_cpp container).
Container needs to be built before hand and started manually.
Build using `docker build -t [container name] ./test` and then run using `docker run -p 8080:8080 [container name]`.
